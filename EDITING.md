# Editing Your Website: A Complete Guide

This guide shows you how to edit your website content and publish updates using GitHub Desktop.

**Your Live Site:** https://isabelzaza.github.io/opl-website/

## The Workflow

1. **Edit** files locally on your computer (in your favorite text editor)
2. **Preview** changes locally in your browser (optional but recommended)
3. **Save** your changes
4. **Open GitHub Desktop** and review what changed
5. **Commit** changes with a descriptive message
6. **Push** to GitHub → site updates automatically in ~30 seconds

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Image and Link Paths

**Always use `{{ site.baseurl }}` before internal paths!**

Your site is at `/opl-website/`, so all internal links need this prefix.

✅ **Correct:**
```markdown
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/photo.jpg" alt="Photo">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research/">Research</a>
```

❌ **Wrong (will cause 404 errors):**
```markdown
<img src="/assets/images/photo.jpg" alt="Photo">
<a href="/research/">Research</a>
```

**Exception:** CSS files use relative paths like `../images/photo.jpg` (don't edit CSS unless you know what you're doing!)

## What You Can Edit

### Content Files (Easy - Just Edit Text)

All your main content is in markdown files (`.md`) in the website folder:

- **index.md** - Homepage
- **research.md** - Research page
- **people.md** - People/team page
- **publications.md** - Publications list
- **resources.md** - Resources page
- **contact.md** - Contact information

### Style Files (Advanced)

To change colors, fonts, or layout:

- **_sass/_colors.scss** - All color definitions
- **_sass/_variables.scss** - Fonts, spacing, sizes
- **_sass/main.scss** - Layout and styling

---

## Step-by-Step: Editing Content

### Example: Adding a New Publication

1. **Open the file** in your text editor:
   - TextEdit, VS Code, Sublime Text, or any editor
   - File: `publications.md`

2. **Find the right year section** (or create a new one):

   ```markdown
   ## 2026
   ```

3. **Add your publication** using this format:

   ```markdown
   <div class="publication">
   <div class="pub-title">Your Paper Title Here</div>
   <div class="pub-authors">Author1, A., Author2, B., & Author3, C.</div>
   <div class="pub-venue">Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Pages. <a href="URL">pdf</a></div>
   </div>
   ```

4. **Save the file** (Cmd+S)

5. Continue to "Publishing Changes" section below

### Example: Updating the People Page

1. **Open** `people.md`

2. **To add a new team member**, copy this template:

   ```markdown
   <div class="person-card">
     <a href="https://scholar.google.com/LINK">Name Here</a>
     <div class="title">Position/Title</div>
   </div>
   ```

3. **To add a photo** (optional):
   - Put the photo in `assets/images/`
   - Add before the name in the card:

   ```markdown
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/name.jpg" alt="Name">
   ```

   **IMPORTANT:** Always use `{{ site.baseurl }}` before `/assets/` for images and links!

4. **Save the file**

### Example: Editing the Homepage

1. **Open** `index.md`
2. **Edit the text** between the `---` markers (that's your content)
3. **Save**

Simple as that!

## Previewing Changes Locally (Before Publishing)

**Highly recommended** - see exactly how changes will look before publishing.

### One-Time Setup

If you haven't already:

```bash
cd "/Users/gauthii/Dropbox/_WORKING ON THESE/NewWebSite"
bundle install
```

### Start the Preview Server

```bash
cd "/Users/gauthii/Dropbox/_WORKING ON THESE/NewWebSite"
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You'll see:
```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

### View Your Site

1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:4000/opl-website/`
   - Note: Include `/opl-website/` at the end!
2. Your site appears exactly as it will online
3. Make changes to files
4. Refresh browser - changes appear automatically!
5. When done, press **Ctrl+C** in Terminal to stop the server

**Tip:** If images don't show when previewing locally, make sure you're using the full URL with `/opl-website/` at the end.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Making Multiple Changes

Feel free to:
- Edit multiple files
- Make several changes at once
- Preview everything locally first
- Commit and push them all together

### Commit Message Tips

Good commit messages help you track changes:

✅ Good:
- "Added 5 new publications from 2025"
- "Updated Melina's bio and photo"
- "Fixed broken link in resources"

❌ Too vague:
- "Updates"
- "Changes"
- "Fixed stuff"

### If You Make a Mistake

Don't panic! Git tracks everything.

**To undo changes before committing:**
- In GitHub Desktop, right-click the file → "Discard changes"

**To undo a commit you already pushed:**
- Contact someone familiar with Git, or
- Just make a new commit fixing the mistake

### Markdown Formatting Quick Reference

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**bold text**
*italic text*

[Link text](http://url.com)

- Bullet point
- Another bullet

1. Numbered list
2. Another item
```

## Common Editing Tasks

### Add a Lab Photo

1. Put photo in `assets/images/`
2. In your markdown file, use this format:
   ```markdown
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/photo.jpg" alt="Description">
   ```

   Or for markdown syntax:
   ```markdown
   ![Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/photo.jpg)
   ```

   **CRITICAL:** Always include `{{ site.baseurl }}` before the path!

### Change Colors

1. Open `_sass/_colors.scss`
2. Find the color variable (e.g., `$sky-blue`)
3. Change the hex code (e.g., `#7CB9E8` to `#4A90D9`)
4. Save and preview

### Update Navigation

1. Open `_includes/header.html`
2. Find the `<nav>` section
3. Add a new link:
   ```html
   <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newpage/">New Page</a></li>
   ```
4. Create `newpage.md` with content

   **IMPORTANT:** Navigation links also need `{{ site.baseurl }}`!

### Add a News Section

1. Create `news.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   layout: default
   title: News
   ---

   # Lab News

   ## January 2026
   - News item here
   - Another update
   ```

2. Add to navigation in `_includes/header.html`

## Troubleshooting

### Preview server won't start

```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd "/Users/gauthii/Dropbox/_WORKING ON THESE/NewWebSite"

# Reinstall dependencies
bundle install

# Try again
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Changes don't appear locally

- Save your files (Cmd+S)
- Refresh browser (Cmd+R)
- Check Terminal for error messages

### Changes don't appear on live site

- Wait 30-60 seconds after pushing
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cache
- Check if you pushed: In GitHub Desktop, it should say "No local changes"
- Visit https://github.com/isabelzaza/opl-website to verify your changes are there
- Check build status: https://github.com/isabelzaza/opl-website/actions
  - Should show a green checkmark ✓

### Images showing as broken on live site

- Make sure you used `{{ site.baseurl }}` before the path
- Check the image file exists in `assets/images/`
- File names are case-sensitive: `Photo.jpg` ≠ `photo.jpg`
- After fixing, commit and push again

### GitHub Desktop doesn't see changes

- Make sure you saved the file
- Check that you're in the right repository
- Try closing and reopening GitHub Desktop
