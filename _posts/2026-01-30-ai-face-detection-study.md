A [new study from the Object Perception Lab](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/news/2026/01/28/new-study-examines-why-some-people-can-more-easily-detect-ai-imagery/){: target="_blank"} reveals that object recognition ability—not intelligence, AI experience, or face recognition skills—is the strongest predictor of who can identify AI-generated faces. The research, led by Isabel Gauthier with Jason Chow and Rankin McGugin, developed the AI Face Test to measure individual differences in distinguishing real from AI-generated faces.
